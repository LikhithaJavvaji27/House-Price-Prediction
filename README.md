# House Price Prediction
A lot of consideration and research must go into the major choice of a person's lifeâ€”buying a home. One wants to purchase a home at the best price with the least amount of risk and with the expectation that it will be the best investment going forward. Home buyers can compare several residences that are for sale thanks to a number of online resources, real estate professionals, and real estate agents. Finding a house with specific features in a certain range of price will be more difficult because year by year the demand for a house will get change as it may depend on the city or depending upon the environmental changes. Prices depend on the current economy.

To find the best model to predict the house price used below models: 
1. Support Vector Machine  
2. Linear Regression 
3. Decision Tree Regression 
4. Gradient Boosting  
5. Random Forest

In this project a user can give his house dimensions like year_built, sqft_living, bathrooms, bedrooms, floors etc and they can predict the price of a house. We checked the accuracy and predicted the price of a house by using above mentioned models. Got the best accuracy for Random Forest Regression.

Execution Steps:
1. First need to download the dataset HousePricePrediction.csv
2. In the Jupyter notebook open the code file and can check the results of our project.
